            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>What happens if an SLA is missed?</h4>
            <p>We track SLA compliance monthly and report it transparently in our management reports. If we miss an SLA target:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Root Cause Analysis:</strong> We investigate why the SLA was missed and document findings in detail</li>
                <li><strong>Corrective Action:</strong> We implement process or staffing changes to prevent recurrence</li>
                <li><strong>Transparent Reporting:</strong> SLA misses are included in the monthly report with full explanation</li>
                <li><strong>Service Credits:</strong> Repeated SLA misses may result in service credits as defined in our contract</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> SLA targets are goals, not absolute guarantees. Resolution time depends on issue complexity, vendor support requirements, and client responsiveness. We commit to best efforts and transparent communication throughout.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>How are maintenance windows planned and scheduled?</h4>
            <p>Maintenance windows follow a structured approval process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard Windows:</strong> Monthly patching windows are pre-scheduled at agreed times (typically weekend off-hours)</li>
                <li><strong>Change Requests:</strong> Larger changes require formal change request with business justification and risk assessment</li>
                <li><strong>Business Calendar:</strong> We avoid month-end, quarter-end, year-end, and industry-specific busy periods</li>
                <li><strong>Advance Notice:</strong> Minimum 5 business days advance notification to all stakeholders</li>
                <li><strong>Change Freeze:</strong> We respect change freeze periods during critical business events</li>
