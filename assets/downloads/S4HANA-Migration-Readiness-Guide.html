    <h1>S/4HANA Migration Readiness Checklist</h1>
    <p><strong>A practical guide to assessing your organization's preparedness for S/4HANA transformation</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Moving from SAP ECC to S/4HANA represents one of the most significant technology transitions an SAP customer will undertake. With SAP ECC 6.0 mainstream maintenance ending in 2027 (with extended support available until 2030 for additional fees), organizations must begin planning their S/4HANA journey. This guide provides a structured approach to assess your readiness and identify preparation activities needed before embarking on this transformation.</p>
    
    <p>S/4HANA is not simply an upgrade—it represents a fundamental platform change with a completely redesigned data model, new user experience, and cloud-ready architecture. Success requires careful preparation across technical, functional, and organizational dimensions. Organizations that conduct thorough readiness assessments experience shorter implementation timelines, lower costs, and fewer business disruptions.</p>
    
    <h2>Technical Readiness Assessment</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Run SAP Readiness Check</h3>
    <p>SAP provides a free readiness check tool that analyzes your current system and identifies technical prerequisites for S/4HANA. This automated scan examines your system configuration, installed components, and data structures to highlight areas requiring attention.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Key areas analyzed:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simplification Database:</strong> Identifies business functions that have changed or been replaced in S/4HANA</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Code Analysis:</strong> Scans ABAP programs for incompatible syntax or obsolete function modules</li>
        <li><strong>Add-on Compatibility:</strong> Checks whether your add-ons are certified for S/4HANA</li>
        <li><strong>Data Volume Assessment:</strong> Analyzes table sizes to estimate migration effort and downtime</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The readiness check generates a detailed report prioritizing issues by severity. Address critical items before proceeding with migration planning. Run this check 12-18 months before your planned migration to allow adequate time for remediation.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Custom Code Analysis</h3>
    <p>Custom ABAP code represents one of the largest migration challenges. SAP has removed or changed numerous data structures in S/4HANA, requiring code modifications. The Custom Code Migration app (available in SAP Fiori) provides detailed analysis of required changes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Common code issues:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>References to obsolete tables (e.g., BSEG split into BSEG and ACDOCA)</li>
        <li>Use of removed function modules or BAPIs</li>
        <li>Direct database access to changed table structures</li>
        <li>Incompatible SQL syntax in native SQL statements</li>
        <li>References to decommissioned transactions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Estimate 2-6 months for custom code remediation depending on your code volume and complexity. Prioritize changes based on business criticality and usage frequency. Consider this an opportunity to eliminate unused code and improve program efficiency.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Add-on and Integration Compatibility</h3>
    <p>Third-party add-ons and integration middleware must be certified for S/4HANA. Contact each vendor to verify compatibility and obtain migration guidance. Some add-ons may require version upgrades or complete replacement with S/4HANA native functionality.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Key integration points to assess:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>EDI/B2B integration platforms</li>
        <li>Business intelligence and reporting tools</li>
        <li>Workflow and approval systems</li>
        <li>Document management systems</li>
        <li>E-commerce and customer portals</li>
        <li>Third-party payroll or time management systems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Interface testing represents a critical activity during S/4HANA migration. Budget adequate time for end-to-end integration testing in your project timeline.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Data Readiness Assessment</h2>
    
    <h3>4. Data Quality Review</h3>
    <p>S/4HANA migration provides an opportunity to improve master data quality. Poor data quality causes migration failures, performance issues, and inaccurate reporting. Conduct data quality assessments focusing on critical master data objects.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Priority areas for data cleanup:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Material Master:</strong> Duplicate materials, incomplete descriptions, incorrect units of measure</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Master:</strong> Duplicate accounts, missing payment terms, incorrect company codes</li>
        <li><strong>Vendor Master:</strong> Duplicate vendors, missing bank details, incorrect purchasing organizations</li>
        <li><strong>General Ledger:</strong> Unused accounts, inconsistent account assignments, missing cost center assignments</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Implement data governance processes to maintain quality post-migration. Assign data ownership and establish regular quality monitoring. Clean data reduces migration risk and improves S/4HANA performance.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Data Volume and Archiving Strategy</h3>
    <p>S/4HANA migration duration correlates directly with data volume. Large transaction tables significantly extend downtime windows. Develop an archiving strategy to reduce data volume before migration.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Archiving candidates:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Closed financial documents beyond retention period</li>
        <li>Completed production orders and confirmations</li>
        <li>Delivered sales orders and invoices</li>
        <li>Application logs and change documents</li>
        <li>Temporary tables and work files</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Balance archiving aggressiveness with business requirements for data access. Implement SAP Data Archiving or Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) solutions to archive systematically. Start archiving 6-12 months before migration to achieve meaningful volume reduction.</p>
    
    <h2>Business Readiness Assessment</h2>
    
    <h3>6. Business Process Review</h3>
    <p>S/4HANA introduces simplified processes and new best practices. Review your current business processes to identify optimization opportunities. Determine whether to maintain current processes (Brownfield approach) or redesign processes (Greenfield approach).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Process assessment questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which processes are working well and should be preserved?</li>
        <li>Which processes are inefficient and should be redesigned?</li>
        <li>Can S/4HANA standard processes replace custom developments?</li>
        <li>What new S/4HANA capabilities should we adopt?</li>
        <li>How will process changes impact users and training requirements?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Engage business process owners early in readiness assessment. Their buy-in is critical for migration success. Document process decisions to guide implementation approach selection.</p>
    
    <h3>7. Change Management Preparation</h3>
    <p>S/4HANA migration requires significant organizational change management. The new SAP Fiori user interface differs substantially from classic SAP GUI. Users require training and support during transition.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Change management activities:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stakeholder identification and engagement</li>
        <li>Communication plan development</li>
        <li>Training needs assessment and curriculum design</li>
        <li>Super user identification and preparation</li>
        <li>Support model definition for go-live period</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Allocate 15-20% of project budget to change management activities. Organizations with strong change management experience higher user adoption and faster time-to-benefit.</p>
    
    <h2>Infrastructure Readiness Assessment</h2>
    
    <h3>8. Infrastructure Sizing</h3>
    <p>S/4HANA runs on SAP HANA database, which requires different infrastructure specifications than traditional databases. HANA operates in-memory, requiring substantially more RAM than disk-based databases. Conduct sizing exercises to determine hardware requirements.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Sizing considerations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Memory requirements based on data volume (typically 3-5x compression ratio)</li>
        <li>CPU requirements based on user count and transaction volume</li>
        <li>Storage requirements for persistent data and backups</li>
        <li>Network bandwidth for data replication and DR</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>SAP provides Quick Sizer tool for initial estimates. Conduct more detailed sizing during planning phase. Budget for infrastructure costs in total project ROI analysis.</p>
    
    <h3>9. Cloud vs. On-Premise Decision</h3>
    <p>S/4HANA migration presents an opportunity to move to cloud infrastructure. Evaluate cloud versus on-premise deployment based on business requirements, cost analysis, and strategic direction.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Cloud considerations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SAP RISE:</strong> Bundled cloud offering including license, infrastructure, and support</li>
        <li><strong>Hyperscaler IaaS:</strong> Deploy S/4HANA on Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud</li>
        <li><strong>On-Premise:</strong> Traditional deployment model with full control</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each approach has implications for project timeline, cost structure, and operational model. Cloud deployments may accelerate implementation but require different skill sets for ongoing management.</p>
    
    <h2>Organizational Readiness Assessment</h2>
    
    <h3>10. Project Team and Governance</h3>
    <p>S/4HANA migration requires dedicated project team with appropriate skills and authority. Assess your organization's capacity to staff and manage a large-scale transformation program.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Required project roles:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Executive sponsor with budget authority</li>
        <li>Project manager with SAP implementation experience</li>
        <li>Business process owners for each module</li>
        <li>Technical architects (Basis, ABAP, integration)</li>
        <li>Change management lead</li>
        <li>Testing coordinator</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Consider external support from SAP partners or consultants to supplement internal capabilities. Establish clear governance structure with regular steering committee meetings and escalation procedures.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>S/4HANA migration readiness assessment identifies technical, business, and organizational gaps that must be addressed for successful transformation. Organizations that invest in thorough readiness activities experience smoother implementations with fewer surprises and lower total costs.</p>
    
    <p>Start readiness assessment 12-18 months before planned migration. Address critical findings before proceeding to detailed project planning. Engage experienced SAP partners to supplement internal capabilities and leverage lessons learned from prior S/4HANA implementations.</p>
    
    <p>The effort invested in readiness assessment pays dividends through reduced project risk, shorter implementation timelines, and higher user adoption. Use this checklist as a starting point for your readiness journey.</p>
